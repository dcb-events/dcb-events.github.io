# Libraries and tools

DCB is merely a set of ideas and concepts.
But there are already a couple of libraries and libraries that prove those in practice:


### JavaScript/TypeScript

- [@dcb-es/event-store](https://github.com/sennentech/dcb-event-sourced) (work in progress)

### PHP

- [wwwision/dcb-eventstore](https://github.com/bwaidelich/dcb-eventstore) (work in progress)


## Add your own

If you are working on a library related to DCB or on a compatible (see [specification](../specification.md)) Event Store, feel free to open a Pull request in the [Github Repository](https://github.com/dcb-events/dcb-events.github.io) of this website to add it to the list above
