# About this website 

## Purpose of This Site

This website was created with the aim of spreading awareness about the concept of the **Dynamic Consistency Boundary** (DCB).

Our goals are threefold:

1. **Explain the rationale** behind the DCB approach.
2. **Provide a practical guide** for those who want to start applying it.
3. **Collect and organize** as many resources as possible on this topic.

This is a **non-commercial project**. We have no financial interest or sponsorship: our motivation is purely educational and driven by a desire to contribute to the tech community.

We believe DCB can be a significant step forward in the design and management of complex systems, and we want to help make it accessible to anyone interested.
