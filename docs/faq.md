Some common questions and misconceptions about DCB:

## Does it promote lack of modeling?

tbd: no :)

## Is it about less strict consistency boundaries?

tbd: name might suggest that, but no :)

## How does it improve performance?

tbd: performance is not the intention of DCB, for large scale & high performance [eventual consistency](/glossary/#eventual-consistency) is even required. Link to [performance](/advanced/performance/)

## How does it scale?

tbd: considerations, link to [performance](/advanced/performance/)

## Does it increase chances of lock collisions?

tbd: no, chances for collisions are _smaller_ because optimistic lock only around required event types / tags

## How can it be used with a "classical" event store?

tbd: link to [DCB with a "classical" Event Store](/advanced/dcb-with-a-classical-event-store/)

## Why do you want to kill aggregates?

tbd: link to example / article about "Aggregate with DCB"
